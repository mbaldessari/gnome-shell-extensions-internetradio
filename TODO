- Multiple stream associated to one radio station (check for network issue and cycle streams)
- Find a better way to manage radio stations (gsettings does not seem to be too useful for multiple dictionaries)
- When you pause a stream and wait long enough and play again, it will play the buffered stuff and then stop
- Fix for latest gnome-shell (debug log output changed there as well)
